## Backlog

### 2026.04.23 (refactor review v0.49.6)

- [x] **LOW / Large** — Split `knowledge_graph/_entity_mixin.py` (639 lines) along its four internal mixin classes (`EntityCRUDMixin`, `EntitySearchMixin`, `EntityMergeMixin`, `EntityHistoryMixin`) into one file per mixin. The module docstring already documents them as four distinct concerns; the file size has crossed the point where navigating them in one file is friction.


### 2026.04.14 (Wikidata import follow-ups)

- [ ] **LOW / Small** — Residual exchange noise after v0.37.1: Deutsche Bank ATS/Off Exchange/Super X, FXCM, Convergex, KCG Americas still slip through. Verify Wikidata QIDs for foreign-exchange broker, alternative trading system, and market maker, then extend the `MINUS` list in `EXCHANGES_QUERY`. Alternatively, maintain a small curated blocklist of QIDs if class-based exclusion keeps missing.
- [ ] **LOW / Small** — Expand curated seed coverage for thin categories surfaced by the overlap review: regulators (SEC, CFTC, ECB-as-regulator, CSRC, BaFin, MAS), top-15 currencies beyond EUR/CHF/GBP, top-15 indices beyond Dow/FTSE 100/Hang Seng/Nasdaq. Curated entries get hand-tuned LLM descriptions, so they beat Wikidata's generic text for resolution quality.

### 2026 March 30th

#### Post-population (after KG is populated)

- [ ] Add `external_ids` table for tickers, ISIN, FIGI, Wikidata QIDs — enables joining KG entities with price feeds and external data sources
- [ ] Build sentiment/signal analysis layer — classify article stance toward entities (positive/negative/neutral), separate from KG provenance

#### Scraping enhancements

- [ ] **LOW** — Podcast transcription pipeline: download BBC Sounds audio and run speech-to-text (e.g. Whisper) to extract text content from podcast episodes — significant effort, but would expand coverage to audio sources
