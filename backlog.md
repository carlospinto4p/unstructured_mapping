## Backlog

### 2026 March 30th

#### KG population (bootstrap + growth)

- [x] **LOW** — Wikidata seed pipeline: query Wikidata SPARQL for financial entities, map to KG schema, bulk-import — heavy but provides broad coverage and external IDs when needed

#### Post-population (after KG is populated)

- [ ] Add `external_ids` table for tickers, ISIN, FIGI, Wikidata QIDs — enables joining KG entities with price feeds and external data sources
- [ ] Build sentiment/signal analysis layer — classify article stance toward entities (positive/negative/neutral), separate from KG provenance

#### Scraping enhancements

- [ ] **LOW** — Podcast transcription pipeline: download BBC Sounds audio and run speech-to-text (e.g. Whisper) to extract text content from podcast episodes — significant effort, but would expand coverage to audio sources
